# Nest Postgres Connection
# 
# IMPORTANT: Choose the right connection string based on where you're running:
#
# 1. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT (running on your Mac/laptop):
#    Use hackclub.app with your password:
#    DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@hackclub.app/username_database
#
# 2. DEPLOYED ON NEST (running on Nest server):
#    Use localhost (no password needed - same server):
#    DATABASE_URL=postgres://username@localhost/username_database?sslmode=disable&host=/var/run/postgresql
#
# Replace:
#   - 'username' with your Nest username (e.g., healthsathi)
#   - 'password' with your Nest password (only needed for remote connections)
#   - 'database' with your database name (usually your username, e.g., healthsathi)
#
# For local development (Mac/laptop):
DATABASE_URL=postgres://healthsathi:YOUR_PASSWORD@hackclub.app/healthsathi
